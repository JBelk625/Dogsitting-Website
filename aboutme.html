                    Full time college student pursing a degree in Software Engineering with a love for animals and baking. Happy to play ball throughout the day or cuddle on the couch. Cats, dogs, rabbits, raccons, and generally anything fluffy im more than happy to sit. I travel to your home and operate out of a room there while you are gone so that the animals routine is disrupted as little as possible, which makes it much easier on your loved ones than tradtional kenels. This model also removes the possiblity of your pets contracting kenel cough.
